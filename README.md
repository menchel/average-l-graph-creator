# average-l-graph-creator

Code for project in Coding and algorithms for memories course (236379) at the Technion.

This is a python code for creating a graph of the average minimal l value using the first algorithm given in the project.

In order to change the values of n and delta, you can change:
n_range = np.linspace(2, 19, 100)
delta_range = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)

According to your prefrences

NOTE: you need the matplotlib libary in order to run this code.
